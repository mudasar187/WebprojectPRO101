# WebprojectPRO101

This is my first web project that we had for the exam at the end of the first year. The web project was about creating a webpage for new students and employees who come to Oslo, and need a page where they can explore the local community around the campus they belong to. Westerdals Oslo ACT has 3 campuses in Oslo distributed on the bachelor lines.
